# tic-tac-toe-ai
This was a school project where I had to implement algorithms for a tic-tac-toe AI. I have added "count" versions of the algorithms that will show the number of possibilities that the AI considered.</br>

Algorithms:</br>
- minimax
- alpha beta pruning

</br>
You are "X".</br>
The AI is "O".</br>
The cells of the tic tac toe grid are labeled 1 through 9 starting from the top left corner.</br>
</br>
Cell labeling visualization:</br>
1 | 2 | 3</br>
4 | 5 | 6</br>
7 | 8 | 9</br>
</br>
The program will randomly pick who goes first.</br>
Type a number 1 through 9 to place an "X" in a desired cell when it is your turn.</br>
Rerun the program to start another game.
